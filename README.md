Steps In Project :
1. Requirement and Business Requirement Gathering
We meet with stakeholders to understand the project's objectives, identify key questions the project aims to answer and the decisions it will support, and Gather requirements for metrics, KPIs, and dashboard deliverables.

2. Data Walkthrough
Understand the data sources (e.g., databases, Excel), Review the data structure, data types, and relationships between different tables, and Identify gaps, missing data, or additional data requirements.
3. Data Connection
Connect to identified data sources using tools like SQL, and Power BI, verify connectivity and data accessibility.
4. Data Cleaning
Handle missing or null values by imputation or removal, Remove duplicate entries to ensure data consistency, Standardize data formats (e.g., dates, numbers, text), and Identify and resolve inconsistencies or errors in the data.
5. Data Processing
Transform data for analysis using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, Aggregate data as needed (e.g., by month, region, or product), and Create intermediate datasets to simplify complex calculations.
6. DAX Calculations (Dynamic Analysis Expressions)
Write DAX formulas for advanced calculations (e.g., time intelligence, ranking, running totals), Create measures for KPIs and key metrics, and Validate calculations against business expectations.
7. Charts Development and Formatting
Select the most appropriate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, scatter plots), Format charts for readability (e.g., axis titles, labels, tooltips), Highlight key insights using colors, markers, or annotations.
8. Dashboard Development
Assemble all visualizations into a cohesive dashboard, Incorporate filters, slicers, and interactive elements for user control, and Ensure all metrics and visuals align with the project objectives.
9. Insights Generation
Analyze the dashboard to derive actionable insights, Create a summary of key findings, trends, and anomalies, and Share insights with stakeholders through presentations or reports.
